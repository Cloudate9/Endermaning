# Endermaning

## Half human, half Enderman. On PaperMC.


This plugin includes configurable Enderman hybrid status, different types of teleporters, customisable teleporter cooldown and damage, silk touch hands, and much more!

Note: This plugin includes a feature (disabled by default) that hides players wearing carved pumpkin from being visible from hybrids. Do note that this feature, when enabled, is likely to break staff/vanish plugins.



Oh and btw, there's a GUI for Endermaning.

To get started with configuring, just do `/edm help` for information, or `/edm` for the GUI.

While it is possible to edit the configs for Endermaning on the fly, it is not recommended to do so. Same for using /reload. It will break some functionality of the plugin.


### Installation
Download this plugin, and drop it into your server's plugin folder!

This plugin is targeted for PaperMc users, and will likely not work on Spigot. You might want to look into PaperMc or PurpurMc if you use Spigot anyway, due to the performance gains offered.

 

### bStats

This program bundles bStats, which sends anonymous data (as shown [here](https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/Endermaning/11128). This data helps me keep track of user metrics. Should you wish to disable this, please go to plugins/bstats/config.yml and follow the instructions there.
